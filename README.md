# In one sentence... 

*"A Non-Fungible Token (NFT) is a cryptographically secured token existing on the blockchain that represents ownership of something unique. NFTs can represent tokenized ownership claims to real-world assets like a specific piece of land, or actual ownership of digital assets as in a rare digital trading card. Unlike fungible tokens such as Bitcoin where one BTC can be exchanged for any other BTC, each NFT is completely unique and represents verifiable digital scarcity."*
